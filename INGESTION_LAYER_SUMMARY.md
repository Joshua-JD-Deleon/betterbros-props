# BetterBros Props - Data Ingestion Layer

## Overview

I've built a comprehensive, production-ready data ingestion layer for BetterBros Props with four main API clients and Redis caching infrastructure.

**Location**: `/Users/joshuadeleon/BetterBros Bets/apps/api/src/ingest/`

## What Was Built

### 1. Sleeper API Client (`sleeper_client.py`)
**485 lines** - NFL player data and statistics

**Features**:
- `get_nfl_players()` - Fetch all NFL players (cached 1 hour)
- `get_player_stats(player_id, season, week)` - Player statistics
- `get_projections(season, week)` - Player projections
- `search_players(query, position, team)` - Search functionality
- `get_player_by_id(player_id)` - Individual player lookup

**Caching**:
- Players: 1 hour TTL
- Stats: 30 minutes TTL
- Projections: 30 minutes TTL

**Key Features**:
- Full async/await support
- Connection pooling (20 keepalive, 50 max)
- Rate limiting with configurable delay (default 0.1s)
- Exponential backoff retry logic (3 attempts)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Health check endpoint

### 2. Injuries Provider (`injuries_provider.py`)
**510 lines** - NFL injury reports from multiple sources

**Features**:
- `get_injury_report(week, season, team)` - Comprehensive injury data
- `get_player_injury(player_name, week)` - Individual player lookup
- `get_team_injuries(team, week)` - Team-specific injuries
- Aggregates from ESPN (public) and SportsRadar (requires API key)

**Injury Statuses**:
- OUT, DOUBTFUL, QUESTIONABLE, PROBABLE, HEALTHY
- IR (Injured Reserve), PUP (Physically Unable to Perform)
- SUSPENSION

**Caching**:
- 6 hours TTL (injuries don't change frequently)

**Key Features**:
- Multi-source aggregation (ESPN + SportsRadar)
- Automatic deduplication
- Normalized status format
- Source metadata tracking
- Fallback to ESPN if SportsRadar unavailable

### 3. Weather Provider (`weather_provider.py`)
**621 lines** - Game weather conditions using OpenWeather API

**Features**:
- `get_game_weather(venue, game_time)` - Weather for specific games
- `get_forecast(venue, date)` - Multi-day forecasts
- `get_weather_impact_score(venue, game_time)` - Impact assessment (0-100)
- Automatic indoor venue detection

**Weather Data**:
- Temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction
- Precipitation probability
- Conditions (Clear, Rain, Snow, etc.)
- Visibility, pressure, cloud cover

**Indoor Venues** (auto-detected):
- AT&T Stadium (Dallas)
- Mercedes-Benz Stadium (Atlanta)
- State Farm Stadium (Arizona)
- U.S. Bank Stadium (Minnesota)
- Allegiant Stadium (Las Vegas)
- SoFi Stadium (LA)
- Ford Field (Detroit)
- Caesars Superdome (New Orleans)
- Lucas Oil Stadium (Indianapolis)

**NFL Venue Coordinates**: 20+ stadiums pre-configured

**Caching**:
- 3 hours TTL

**Weather Impact Scoring**:
- Wind impact: 0-40 points
- Precipitation: 0-30 points
- Temperature: 0-30 points
- Total: 0-100 (with severity recommendations)

### 4. Baseline Stats Provider (`baseline_stats.py`)
**554 lines** - Player and team statistical baselines

**Features**:
- `get_player_baseline(player_id, stat_type, season, week)` - Season averages
- `get_team_stats(team, stat_category, season, week)` - Team aggregations
- `get_rolling_averages(player_id, stat_type, windows)` - Multiple windows (3, 5, 10 games)

**Statistics Calculated**:
- Season average, median, std deviation
- Min/max values
- Rolling averages (3-game, 5-game, etc.)
- Trend detection (up, down, stable)
- Games played count

**Team Statistics**:
- Yards per game (total, passing, rushing)
- TDs per game (total, passing, rushing)
- Turnovers per game
- Estimated points per game

**Caching**:
- 24 hours TTL

**Stat Type Support**:
- Passing: yards, TDs, interceptions
- Rushing: yards, TDs, carries
- Receiving: receptions, yards, TDs, targets
- Fantasy: PPR points, standard points

### 5. Package Exports (`__init__.py`)
**82 lines** - Clean API with health checks

**Exports**:
```python
from src.ingest import (
    SleeperAPI,
    InjuriesAPI,
    WeatherAPI,
    BaselineStats,
    health_check_all,  # Check all services
)
```

**Global Health Check**:
```python
health = await health_check_all()
# Returns overall status + individual service health
```

## Configuration Added

Updated `/Users/joshuadeleon/BetterBros Bets/apps/api/src/config.py`:

```python
# New environment variables
SLEEPER_API_KEY: str | None  # Optional (API is public)
SPORTSRADAR_API_KEY: str | None  # For injury data
OPENWEATHER_KEY: str | None  # For weather data
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Async & Performance
- Full async/await with httpx
- Connection pooling for reused connections
- Parallel request support with `asyncio.gather()`
- Context managers for automatic cleanup

### Caching Strategy
All clients use Redis with appropriate TTLs:
- Frequently changing data: 30 min (stats, projections)
- Moderately stable data: 3-6 hours (weather, injuries)
- Stable data: 24 hours (baselines, player metadata)
- Cache keys follow pattern: `{service}:{entity}:{identifier}`

### Error Handling
- Custom exceptions: `SleeperAPIError`, `InjuriesAPIError`, `WeatherAPIError`, `BaselineStatsError`
- Exponential backoff retry logic (up to 3 attempts)
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- Comprehensive logging at all levels

### Rate Limiting
- Configurable delays between requests
- Automatic backoff on 429 (Too Many Requests)
- Respects API provider limits

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start

```python
from src.ingest import SleeperAPI, InjuriesAPI, WeatherAPI, BaselineStats
from datetime import datetime

# Sleeper - Player Stats
async with SleeperAPI() as sleeper:
    players = await sleeper.search_players("mahomes", position="QB")
    stats = await sleeper.get_player_stats("421", "2024", week=5)

# Injuries - Team Report
async with InjuriesAPI() as injuries:
    kc_injuries = await injuries.get_team_injuries("KC", week=5)

# Weather - Game Conditions
async with WeatherAPI() as weather:
    conditions = await weather.get_game_weather(
        venue="Arrowhead Stadium",
        game_time=datetime(2024, 10, 20, 13, 0)
    )
    impact = await weather.get_weather_impact_score(venue, game_time)

# Baseline Stats - Season Averages
async with BaselineStats() as baseline:
    player_baseline = await baseline.get_player_baseline(
        player_id="421",
        stat_type="passing_yards",
        season="2024",
        current_week=6
    )
    team_stats = await baseline.get_team_stats(
        team="KC",
        stat_category="offense",
        season="2024",
        current_week=6
    )
```

### Health Checks

```python
from src.ingest import health_check_all

health = await health_check_all()
print(health["overall_status"])  # "healthy" or "unhealthy"
print(health["healthy_count"])   # Number of healthy services
```

### Parallel Fetching

```python
import asyncio

async with SleeperAPI() as sleeper:
    # Fetch stats for multiple players concurrently
    tasks = [
        sleeper.get_player_stats(pid, "2024", week=5)
        for pid in player_ids
    ]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

## Testing

### Run Example Demo
```bash
cd /Users/joshuadeleon/BetterBros\ Bets
python -m apps.api.src.ingest.example_usage
```

### Run Integration Tests
```bash
python -m apps.api.src.ingest.integration_test
```

Tests verify:
- Health checks for all services
- Data fetching from each API
- Caching functionality
- Concurrent operations
- Error handling
- Invalid input handling

## Environment Setup

Add to `.env`:

```bash
# Redis (required)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# API Keys (optional but recommended)
SLEEPER_API_KEY=optional_if_needed
SPORTSRADAR_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENWEATHER_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Next Steps

### Integration Points

1. **Features Module**: Use ingestion data to compute features
   ```python
   from src.ingest import SleeperAPI, BaselineStats

   async def compute_player_features(player_id, week):
       stats = await sleeper.get_player_stats(player_id, "2024", week)
       baseline = await baseline.get_player_baseline(player_id, "receiving_yards", "2024", week)
       return {"recent_avg": baseline["avg_last_3"], ...}
   ```

2. **Context Enrichment**: Add to ContextData
   ```python
   from src.ingest import InjuriesAPI, WeatherAPI

   async def enrich_game_context(game_id, venue, game_time):
       injuries = await injuries.get_injury_report(week)
       weather = await weather.get_game_weather(venue, game_time)
       return ContextData(game_id=game_id, injuries=injuries, weather=weather)
   ```

3. **API Endpoints**: Expose via FastAPI
   ```python
   @app.get("/api/v1/players/{player_id}/stats")
   async def get_player_stats(player_id: str, week: int):
       async with SleeperAPI() as sleeper:
           return await sleeper.get_player_stats(player_id, "2024", week)
   ```

4. **Background Jobs**: Schedule data updates
   ```python
   from celery import shared_task

   @shared_task
   async def update_player_cache():
       async with SleeperAPI() as sleeper:
           await sleeper.get_nfl_players(use_cache=False)
   ```
